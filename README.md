# LineCounterPro
LineCounterPro came about when I needed a feature rich and simple to use line counter for several development projects I wanted to track. In researching existing solutions, I came across several abandoned projects that offered varying levels of polish and several paid options that offered clunky interfaces or loads of features I didn't need.

Enter LineCounterPro

LineCounterPro is a simple program, written in C#, that allows you to drag and drop files and folders and calculates the line counts, file counts and file sizes for source code and the count and size of image and other files found during the scan. You can enter a list of file extensions to be included as source code as well as file extensions to exclude during the scan. The extensions captured as image files are .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, and .tiff.

After a scan completes, a summary dialog is shown. The main screen shows a table of the source code files scanned and the associated line counts and file sizes. You can also double click on a row in the table to launch the file directly from the user interface.
